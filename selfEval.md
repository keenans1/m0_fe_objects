# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

keeping track of the proper syntax

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

during live sessions, thats the best time for me

- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

sometimes it can be hard to even know what to google, but thats part of the learning process
especially at the beginning
